/**
 * Base class for creating plugins.
 *
 * <p>Plugins provide a structured way to intercept and modify agent, tool, and LLM behaviors at
 * critical execution points in a callback manner. While agent callbacks apply to a particular
 * agent, plugins applies globally to all agents added in the runner. Plugins are best used for
 * adding custom behaviors like logging, monitoring, caching, or modifying requests and responses at
 * key stages.
 *
 * <p>A plugin can implement one or more methods of callbacks, but should not implement the same
 * method of callback for multiple times.

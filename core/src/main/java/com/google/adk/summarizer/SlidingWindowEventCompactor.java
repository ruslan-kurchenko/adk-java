  /**
   * Runs compaction for SlidingWindowCompactor.
   *
   * <p>This method implements the sliding window compaction logic. It determines if enough new
   * invocations have occurred since the last compaction based on {@link
   * EventsCompactionConfig#compactionInterval()}. If so, it selects a range of events to compact
   * based on {@link EventsCompactionConfig#overlapSize()}, and calls {@link
   * BaseEventSummarizer#summarizeEvents(List)}.
   *
   * <p>The compaction process is controlled by two parameters:
   *
   * <p>1. {@link EventsCompactionConfig#compactionInterval()}: The number of *new* user-initiated
   * invocations that, once fully represented in the session's events, will trigger a compaction. 2.
   * `overlap_size`: The number of preceding invocations to include from the end of the last
   * compacted range. This creates an overlap between consecutive compacted summaries, maintaining
   * context.
   *
   * <p>The compactor is called after an agent has finished processing a turn and all its events
   * have been added to the session. It checks if a new compaction is needed.
   *
   * <p>When a compaction is triggered: - The compactor identifies the range of `invocation_id`s to
   * be summarized. - This range starts `overlap_size` invocations before the beginning of the new
   * block of `compaction_invocation_threshold` invocations and ends with the last invocation in the
   * current block. - A `CompactedEvent` is created, summarizing all events within this determined
   * `invocation_id` range. This `CompactedEvent` is then appended to the session.
   *
   * <p>Here is an example with `compaction_invocation_threshold = 2` and `overlap_size = 1`: Let's
   * assume events are added for `invocation_id`s 1, 2, 3, and 4 in order.
   *
   * <p>1. **After `invocation_id` 2 events are added:** - The session now contains events for
   * invocations 1 and 2. This fulfills the `compaction_invocation_threshold = 2` criteria. - Since
   * this is the first compaction, the range starts from the beginning. - A `CompactedEvent` is
   * generated, summarizing events within `invocation_id` range [1, 2]. - The session now contains:
   * `[ E(inv=1, role=user), E(inv=1, role=model), E(inv=2, role=user), E(inv=2, role=model),
   * CompactedEvent(inv=[1, 2])]`.
   *
   * <p>2. **After `invocation_id` 3 events are added:** - No compaction happens yet, because only 1
   * new invocation (`inv=3`) has been completed since the last compaction, and
   * `compaction_invocation_threshold` is 2.
   *
   * <p>3. **After `invocation_id` 4 events are added:** - The session now contains new events for
   * invocations 3 and 4, again fulfilling `compaction_invocation_threshold = 2`. - The last
   * `CompactedEvent` covered up to `invocation_id` 2. With `overlap_size = 1`, the new compaction
   * range will start one invocation before the new block (inv 3), which is `invocation_id` 2. - The
   * new compaction range is from `invocation_id` 2 to 4. - A new `CompactedEvent` is generated,
   * summarizing events within `invocation_id` range [2, 4]. - The session now contains: `[ E(inv=1,
   * role=user), E(inv=1, role=model), E(inv=2, role=user), E(inv=2, role=model),
   * CompactedEvent(inv=[1, 2]), E(inv=3, role=user), E(inv=3, role=model), E(inv=4, role=user),
   * E(inv=4, role=model), CompactedEvent(inv=[2, 4])]`.
